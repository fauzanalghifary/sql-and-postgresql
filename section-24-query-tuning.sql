 IF USING INDEX
- Find the ID'S of the users with the username 'Alyson14'
   - Get the root node
   - Jump to some random child page
   - Process the values in that node
- Open users heap file
- Jump to each block that has the users we are looking for

 IF NOT USING INDEX
- Open users heap file
- Load all users from the first block
- Process each user, see if it matches the username
- Repeat the process for the next block

 THE CAVEAT => loading data from random spots off a hard drive is slower than loading data from sequential spots
